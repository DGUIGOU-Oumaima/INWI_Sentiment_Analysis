for the first 2 years it was probably the best internet provider i have ever used, veeery stable, zero problems.

and than they decided to change something, ping is all over the place, packet loss is more like a bitcoin chart.

i still use it but mainly when im not near a stable wifi.

15gb&1hour for 50dhs is a very good deal for me",13,"i have it for a looong time, since they started, i used to game with it.

If you use up your monthly data, you can seamlessly move into the next package as if you had bought it at the beginning of the month, which is really nice! Speeds are satisfactory when the network doesn't hang. 

Con: at times unreliable: WhatsApp calls and messages don't come through, everything takes 10 seconds to load instead of tenth of a second, and sometimes it absolutely refuses to work with my VPN. Very frustrating. 

When this month ends I'll go back to IAM for 5GB/50dh to see if the performance is more reliable, since most of the time I didn't even use more than 5GB.

At first everything was normal, they asked me their usual useless questions like what‚Äôs my email and name and stuff‚Ä¶.

We talked a bit but it was all in vain, they told me that my request is sent to the department of something like they always do
The scary part is the following, after some time of talking I realized that the typing animation appeared for quite a while(a solid 30-40 seconds) and no message was sent by them, and out of curiosity I looked at my front camera and i did the ‚úåüèªsign just for fun, then a paragraph appeared and disappeared so quickly, and all my eyes could catch from that paragraph is:
( Mr Houssaine dok joj sba3‚Ä¶‚Ä¶) 
I immediately shutdown my phone, my heart sank, I couldn‚Äôt believe it, how tf a company that provides telecom services can spy on people like that.

It‚Äôs unacceptable and illegal, what guarantees that they‚Äôre not spying on you right now reading this
Seeing what you‚Äôre doing, and hearing what you‚Äôre saying.

They migrated my number from my former T√©l√©com operator flawlessly and delivered the new sim card to my door step.

After that it was very nice to have the option to change the number of hours and data plan every month if I needed to. I could add more GB to my data plan or hours for calling according to what I needed to do the next month.

1,2024-10-27 07:26:45,"R5: I played Ming and stacked a threesome of achievements while doing so. Sweet Harmony came first (thanks to the Jezuits arriving in China and giving me a Catholic province). Then came Kow-Tow, by releasing and then tributary Coptic Mehdi Bahri and finally, after getting to the Age of Revolutions to ignore coring distance, Copium Wars.

It was mostly a playing tall game (average dev is about 30-35 in China) as you get sooo rich and get sooo much tribute that you'll always have excess monarch points. I devved so much, that I'm at gov capacity even while owning so few land directely and having build town halls and the occasional state house.

I ended up with 20 tributaries, but during the run a lot of them got eaten by the bigger guys. Oirat and Bengal gobbled up quite a few, but Ayuttayah was King. I was happy to get to the Age of Revolutions to get the Anti-Revolutionary Zeal for -33% liberty desire from dev. To give you an idea, Ayuttayah is maintaining an army of 605k and sits at 2260 dev. 

I passed almost all reforms. Only the one requiring more banners and an explorer remained unchecked. I started the game with Court ideas which helps a lot with your mandate & focused on leveling up the Beijing monument as well as everything that decreased or limited devastation (canal wonders). Also built a fort to cover all China provinces, because even while watching your mandate and only triggering a reform at 100, you still get hit by floods and earthquakes a lot.

I switched out court ideas later for Maritime as I was severely struggling with naval force limit (which of course money can solve too). As a second idea I took quality (Ming ideas don't help you a lot militarily), Trade third (to get more merchants & reinforce my trade position > I had the idea to only conquer CoT in overseas areas, giving me the opportunity to tributary more nations, and thought it would be nice to still be able to get the Trade Company merchangs). Next came humanis to help with Harmonisation of religions & then ""quality of life"" Offensive for better siege ability. With all my trade outposts and the necessity to take Britain, I also took Naval. Quantity was useful to get the military hegemon. I could have taken economic hegemon around 1650 but I felt it wasn't too helpful as I had most stuff fully stated.

The Harmony mechanism is really cool. I got Mahayana (for -10% idea cost), Shinto (for +10% infantry combat ability), Theravada (for -10% advisor cost), Vajrayana (for +10% production efficiency), Christian (for -10% stab cost), Pagan (for -1 national unrest), Muslim (for +10% trade efficiency) and Hindu (for +1 diplo rep).

Ming economy is of course super strong. And with the ideas, it was also possible to beat back the Ottobros on the Arabian Peninsula to assure my trade dominance in the Gulf of Aden. Great Britain was mostly a paper tiger at the time I came at them. Even though they had been able to hold back France on the continent, and had a personal union with Sweden, they only had one colonial nation in North America. I completely destroyed their fleet, even with their wooden wall idea & like always, after taking a foothold on their island, it was easy pickings. I did release Scotland and Wales (Northumberland had disappeared and Cornwall wasn't very useful with only one core left) to speed things up a bit, but I still needed 4 wars (at 100% absolutism) to gobble up all their holdings on the islands. I suppose I could have played more efficiently (not taking diplo this time). 

The hardest part is the start, managing your mandate, but the mission tree is worked out quite well in the way that it steers you to do the right things. You should definitely give it a shot.",2,"R5 I played Ming and stacked a threesome of achievements while doing so. Sweet Harmony came first (thanks to the Jezuits arriving in China and giving me a Catholic province). Then came Kow-Tow, by releasing and then tributary Coptic Mehdi Bahri and finally, after getting to the Age of Revolutions to ignore coring distance, Copium Wars.

It was mostly a playing tall game (average dev is about 30-35 in China) as you get sooo rich and get sooo much tribute that you'll always have excess monarch points. I devved so much, that I'm at gov capacity even while owning so few land directely and having build town halls and the occasional state house.

I ended up with 20 tributaries, but during the run a lot of them got eaten by the bigger guys. Oirat and Bengal gobbled up quite a few, but Ayuttayah was King. I was happy to get to the Age of Revolutions to get the Anti-Revolutionary Zeal for -33% liberty desire from dev. To give you an idea, Ayuttayah is maintaining an army of 605k and sits at 2260 dev. 

I passed almost all reforms. Only the one requiring more banners and an explorer remained unchecked. I started the game with Court ideas which helps a lot with your mandate & focused on leveling up the Beijing monument as well as everything that decreased or limited devastation (canal wonders). Also built a fort to cover all China provinces, because even while watching your mandate and only triggering a reform at 100, you still get hit by floods and earthquakes a lot.

We need a squad of current players good enough but have some players on the back burner bubbling away who could then step up in the future. RB Salzburg are very good at this strategy. Look at Transfermarkt and be sickened at how much they spend compared to how much they make every summer."

Just install kwlp, install Goodluck and also lockstar. 
1.once kwlp is installed, create a new project and set it as your wallpaper.
2. Create a square and make it show the album cover
3. In the background Create a rectangle and make it fit your screen, also make it show you cover art, and make sure to blur it to about 85%
4.th you can make your own clock and date to fit the color scheme of the album art (if so make a clock and date and set the filter to overlay so it makes a cool filter to fit most cover arts)
4.2- if you don't want the hassle of making a clock you could always use the samsung one, just go to lockstar make the clock and music layer fit with the lockscreen and you're good to go

I know I haven't gotten much in depth on the kwlp aspect since it's VERY hard to explain the whole process in text form and my internet is very vary bad to upload a video you can just Google ""how to set cover art image  to square  in kwlp""and it'll give you everything you need to get started
PS: Kwlp may or may not drain your battery a tad bit faster since it's live wallpaper but it all depends on your phone. Also if you opt to choose the built in samsung clock you won't get the adaptive clock color since samsung for some reason does not allow auto coloring for livewallpaper (classic samsung) so will have a more functional clock( you can press on it to get the info and all) or you can get a aesthetic clock. The choice is always yours!

3. In the background Create a rectangle and make it fit your screen, also make it show you cover art, and make sure to blur it to about 85%
4.th you can make your own clock and date to fit the color scheme of the album art (if so make a clock and date and set the filter to overlay so it makes a cool filter to fit most cover arts)
4.2- if you don't want the hassle of making a clock you could always use the samsung one, just go to lockstar make the clock and music layer fit with the lockscreen and you're good to go

I know I haven't gotten much in depth on the kwlp aspect since it's VERY hard to explain the whole process in text form and my internet is very vary bad to upload a video you can just Google ""how to set cover art image  to square  in kwlp""and it'll give you everything you need to get started
PS Kwlp may or may not drain your battery a tad bit faster since it's live wallpaper but it all depends on your phone. Also if you opt to choose the built in samsung clock you won't get the adaptive clock color since samsung for some reason does not allow auto coloring for livewallpaper (classic samsung) so will have a more functional clock( you can press on it to get the info and all) or you can get a aesthetic clock. The choice is always yours!

Happy customization!"
